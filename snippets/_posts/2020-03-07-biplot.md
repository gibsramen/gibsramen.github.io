EDIT (03/10/2020): Plot and code updated to appear better on screen.

One of the things I find myself doing fairly frequently is plotting biplots. A biplot is basically a principle components analysis (PCA) plot + a loading plot. When you perform PCA, you typically plot the samples in the first two or three PCs. What you can also do is plot the features of your dataset to see how strongly each one contributes to the PCs. When you combine these two plots, you get a powerful visualization. In my research area, these are often used to see which features (usually microbes) are driving separation of samples by some biological variable (diet, genotype, etc.).

Usually these come in the form of `.qza` files from Qiime which are just fancy wrappers for `skbio` [ordination results](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.5.1/generated/generated/skbio.stats.ordination.OrdinationResults.html) in this case. I've found that plotting the samples in PC space is not super straightforward - typically (at least in Qiime), the [q2-emperor](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-emperor) tool is used to view the biplot. This is a great tool, and I like it a lot, but it's not super useful for publication-ready figures (at least in my opinion!). I like to fiddle around with matplotlib a lot - looking at plot layouts, axes, colors, etc. You can certainly download the emperor plots as `.png` or `.svg` files, but editing these after the fact is not really my style.

I wrote some skeleton code to process ordination results and plot them that I've outlined below. I'm going to be use the `ordination.qza` file from the [DEICODE tutorial](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/robust-aitchison-pca-beta-diversity-with-deicode/8333) written by my friend Cameron Martino. If you are not using a `.qza` file, feel free to ignore that part of the code.
